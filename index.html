        <p>I have been working as a freelance designer and front-end developer since 2021. Iâ€™ve always been someone who has both a creative and a logical side. When I discovered web design in college, I realized it would be the perfect fit. I could use my creative side to design and my logical side to code. As a bonus, being both designer and developer allows me to make sure no detail is lost in translation.</p>
